# TLCN_Connect

About TLCN Connect:

  Hi, TLCN Connect was a project I did as a final project of a training with Simplon (Lyon, France).

  The concept: basically a catalog of the journalists who collaborate with https://telocuentonews.com/ (TLCN) An independent digital media, created by a Venezuelan woman who         emigrated to the United States.

  This catalog (TLCN Connect) would be an exclusive access for our supporters over Patreon. 

  I am now working in my free time to make this project more than an idea, as it could be a way to support the work of independent journalists (like myself and my colleagues and     friends at TLCN).


Tecnical aspects:

  - The original proyect use only HTML, CSS and bootstrap

  - I use code of thirds parties, I reference the sources in the comments

  - For now my code, specially in the css file? is not very friendly as I use a mix of spanish, english and french to create my classes and IDs. But i think the comments help         enough and I will be applying changes 

   - I deployed this proyect over here:

        https://telocuentonewsconnect.netlify.app/index.html 

        - For now all the files are cloned (there's inside folders version and outsite folders version), this is because  netlify was not detecting the index.html file inside              the folder, so I experimented and this clone startegy was the safest solution

        - "Easter egg": 

            Is you go to the deployed version and click in the buttom "conectate" (that's inside the section with the same name) you will be taken to the home page the users                    will see when they log in (that is as far i code the original project).
            
 Last but not less:
 
  Thanks to Simplon for give me the opportunity and my first experience in programmer enviroment. Thanks specially to Rama and Jean, our instructors. Thanks to all my classmates  aswell for their help and the good times!
